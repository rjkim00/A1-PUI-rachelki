                        <p class="description-1">My family decided to travel to Seattle, Washington during the summer of 2018.
                            That summer was quite special. Everyone in the Kim Family was full of joy and excitement. I had 
                            just graduated high school and I was looking forward to a new chapter of my life - Carnegie Mellon 
                            University. My older brother had also achieved his goal to intern at Amazon, which opened up his 
                            chapter in Seattle.
                        </p>
                        <p class="description-2">My parents, who have never taken a day off from work, wanted to celebrate and
                            go on a little family vacation for once. With my brother located in Seattle for the summer, they
                            thought it was the perfect opportunity to explore a new city. However, it wasn't simply a little family
                            vacation to me. My parents constantly work hard to support me and my brother, which is why they never
                            take days off or go on vacation and travel. Once I can support myself in the future, I hope to create 
                            more memories like this with my family.
                        </p>
